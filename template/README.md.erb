## Usage

### Install dependencies

1. If you have not already done so, configure [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation)
and [`ruby-build`](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#installation) on your
workstation and [install Ruby 2.1.5](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-versions).
1. Ensure that a supported version of [bundler](http://bundler.io/) is installed (`">= 1.5.2", "<= 1.10.6"`):

  ```bash
  gem install bundler -v 1.10.6
  ```

1. Use `bundler` to install application-specific dependencies"

  ```bash
  bundle install
  ```

1. **Optionally**, add an alias for `build`. In `$HOME/.profile` or `$HOME/bash_profile`
add the following, then reload your profile:

  ```bash
  alias build="bundle exec build"
  ```

  ```bash
  . ~/.profile
  ```

  **All subsequent examples with a `build` command assume that you've created an alias
  or are prepending `bundle exec` to the command string**

### Start a local Vagrant VM, then SSH into it.

```bash
build local
build vagrant ssh
```

To clean up VMs, run

```bash
build vagrant destroy
```

### Launch an EC2 instance

```bash
build ec2
build vagrant ssh
```

### Clean up VMs and local generated resources

```bash
build clean
```
